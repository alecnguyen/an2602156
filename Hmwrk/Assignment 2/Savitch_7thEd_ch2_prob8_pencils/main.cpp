 * Purpose: It is difficult to make a budget that spans several years, because prices are
 * not stable. If your company needs 200 pencils per year, you cannot simply
 * use this yearâ€™s price as the cost of pencils two years from now. Because of
 * inflation the cost is likely to be higher than it is today. Write a program to
 * gauge the expected cost of an item in a specified number of years. The program
 * asks for the cost of the item, the number of years from now that the
 * item will be purchased, and the rate of inflation. The program then outputs
 * the estimated cost of the item after the specified period. Have the user enter
 * the inflation rate as a percentage, like 5.6 (percent). Your program should
 * then convert the percent to a fraction, like 0.056, and should use a loop to
 * estimate the price adjusted for inflation. (Hint: This is similar to computing
 * interest on a charge card account, which was discussed in this chapter.)
