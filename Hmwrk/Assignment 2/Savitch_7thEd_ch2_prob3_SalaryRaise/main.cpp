 * Purpose: Write a program that takes an employeeâ€™s previous annual 
 * salary as input, and outputs the amount of retroactive pay due the employee,
 * the new annual salary, and the new monthly salary. Use a variable declaration
 * with the modifier const to express the pay increase. Your program
 * should allow the calculation to be repeated as often as the user wishes.
